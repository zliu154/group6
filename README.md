## **Group Project Introduction**
Create a project that can check the format of the output

- PH: previousBlockHash 
- D: data 
- RN: randomNumber
- CH: currentBlockhash
- blank line
- Next block
- Repeat for all blocks

The second python file is check their values are all meet the question and show they are all valid. 
check the previousBlockHash not empty. and generate the hash of the previous block and  compare it.
valid the digit of random number present in the currentblock hash.
Regenerate value of currentBlockhash as in iteration 1 and compare with this value read from the file.
if 3 conditions are met then the block then valid. Else show error.


## **Program instructions**
- The Iteration #1 block.py is for the output format.
it will show the previousBlockHash, data, randomNumber, currentBlockhash <blank line> <Next block>.
and it will repeat for all blocks.
it will show 4 records or data for 4 semesters though the sampledata.txt file.

- The teration #2 bcvalidator.py is for check the previousBlockHash not empty. and generate the hash of the previous block and compare it.
valid the digit of random number present in the currentblock hash.
Regenerate value of currentBlockhash as in iteration 1 and compare with this value read from the file.
if above are oks then check the next block till they are all valid if not show error and exit.
final show the reault that all blockschains are compare with the information and show they are all valid.
